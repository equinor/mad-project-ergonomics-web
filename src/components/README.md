# Components
components are organized by feature or common. 

If you are developing a feature of the application create a folder for the feature. Place all components of the feature in this folder. 
If you notice a component can be re-used, move it out to common. 

There are two folders added for demo:
- public_feature 
- authorized_feature 
Remove these folders and add your own.
